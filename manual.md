# User Manual

### Set-up
To run this project please download the Monkey C SDK (Software Development Kit) and follow the instructions for adding the Monkey C extention to Visual Studio via the following link: https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/

After that run the application in simulation, here you can traverse the app and simulate activity data to view what the Activity page would look like in motion:

Unfortunatley ANT communication cannot be simulated, you need to run the application on a Garmin device to do so. Therefore, the FTP calculator, power meter and radar pages cannot be displayed properly in simulation.
