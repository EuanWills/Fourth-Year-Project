To run this project please download the Monkey C SDK (Software Development Kit) and follow the instructions for adding the Monkey C extention to Visual Studio via the following link: https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/

After that run the application in simulation, here you can traverse the app and simulate activity data to view what the Activity page would look like in motion:

Unfortunatley ANT communication cannot be simulated, you need to run the application on a Garmin device to do so. Therefore, the FTP calculator, power meter and radar pages cannot be displayed properly in simulation.

Alternativley, if you have an Edge 530, plug it into your computer and navigate to the following menu to download the program onto your device.
